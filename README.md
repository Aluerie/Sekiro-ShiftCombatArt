# üíÉ Sekiro mod - Rebind Combat Art to Shift modifier

* Did you ever press Deflect + Attack buttons together by accident in a game where you constantly spam Deflect and Attack buttons?.. which results in you stupidly standing here slashing Mortal Draw for 2 seconds.
* Did you ever watch your keyboard logs to find out that that one time you actually didn't fuck it up and you had 0.03 seconds between un-pressing Deflect and pressing Attack down?..

My answer to both of these questions is "Yes". I've done a lot of accidental/unwanted combat arts. This mod tries to provide a solution.

## ü§î What does this mod actually do?

Quite simple:

* When you hold Shift down - it equips the Mortal Draw;
* When you let Shift up - it unequips the Mortal Draw;

Simply put, now you need to hold Shift down to be able to use the Mortal Draw. This way you can never accidentally press it.

So now you need to press 3 keys combo: Block+Attack while holding Shift down. Bonus trick to reduce this to 2 keys: in-game settings bind your Block keyboard button to Shift: this way you only need to press Shift+Attack since the game will start blocking for you automatically.

Funnily enough, this way it works in same fashion as Katanas' skill in Elden Ring/Dark Souls 3. I mean "Unsheathe"-like weapon arts where you hold your skill button (and character takes ready-stance) into pressing light attack that releases the weapon art like Moonveil/Frayed Blade/Uchigatana/etc. With my keybinds Wolf first goes into blocking stance (the ready-stance) and then we press light attack to release the Mortal Draw.

## üî¨ Installation

* Go to Releases tab, grab the archive.
    * If you want to use the latest version from master branch then go to `ShiftArt/ForRelease` and take all the content.
    * PS. Yes, currently, I'm super noob and the script won't run without all these images. Idk how to un-spaghetti the code to stop loading them. Any help is appreciated.
* Paste it into the same folder with `sekiro.exe`
* If you get prompted to replace `dinput8.dll` (because you use Mod Engine or something):
    * Rename `dinput8.dll` to something like `shiftart.dll`
    * Chain load with mod engine - edit `modengine.ini` according to instructions in the comments of that file.
    * for other `dinput8.dll`-using mods refer to their chain-loading practices.
* Ready. Now you can run Sekiro and try out holding shift into pressing Block+Attack buttons.

## üëê Credits

As you can notice from forking note, I found that most of needed code-base already exists in other mod: [tmsrise/Sekiro-Weapon-Wheel](https://github.com/tmsrise/Sekiro-Weapon-Wheel) so all credits to them.

Also, I'm extremely noob in C++ myself. This mod probably can be done in 100x less lines, but I just took tmsrise's mod and edited a few lines for my own desires. So I still have all the code that loads in weapon wheel, it's just not fully used. Sorry about that.

So anyway, if anybody can help - please, I beg you, help me and teach me.

## üóûÔ∏è ToDo

### üß™ Soon^tm

* Remove all unnecessary references to stuff from the original mod like images, fonts, GUI, Wheel, Wheel settings, prosthetic tools

### üåà Dream tier todo list

* Allow customizing the keybind
* Allow customizing the combat art
* I don't know what happens when you don't have the Mortal Draw available yet.
